/*! \file HiReconstruction.hpp
 * This class implements a high order surface/curve reconstruction method which takes a surface/curve mesh as input 
 * and compute local polynomial fittings (in monomial basis) around user specified vertices. Little noise is allowed and least square 
 * will be used in such case. 
 * This method assumes the underlying geometry of input mesh is smooth.
 * The local fitting results could be used for estimate the exact geometry of the surface. For instance, if mesh 
 *  refinement is perform on the input mesh, then the position of new vertices introduced by refinement could be 
 * estimated by the local fitting, rather than using linear interpolation.
 * Implementations are based on the WALF method in paper:
 * Jiao, Xiangmin, and Duo Wang. "Reconstructing high-order surfaces for meshing." Engineering with Computers 28.4 (2012): 361-373.
